      <h2>Compendium Nav Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 13, 2025</p>

      <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
      <p>Compendium Nav ("we," "us," or "our") provides a marine operations companion app that connects to a dedicated onboard server. This policy describes how we collect, use, and safeguard information when you use the Compendium Nav application and related services.</p>

      <h3>2. Information We Collect</h3>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Account Data:</strong> Name, email address, and credentials you supply during account registration, stored on our private VPS.</li>
        <li><strong>Boat Server Data:</strong> Operational data (weather, tides, GPS position, Bluetooth sensor readings) generated by your onboard server and transmitted to the app. This data is retained on your server.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Device identifiers and basic diagnostic logs necessary to troubleshoot technical issues.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do not collect payment information, advertising identifiers, or behavioral analytics.</p>

      <h3>3. How We Use Information</h3>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Authenticate and secure user access.</li>
        <li>Deliver real-time weather, tide, navigation, and Bluetooth sensor data from your boat server to your device.</li>
        <li>Maintain service reliability and resolve technical issues.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Data Storage & Retention</h3>
      <p>Account data is hosted on our private VPS in the United States. Boat data remains on your local server. When you connect from off-boat, data transits through our VPS without being persisted. We retain account records while your account remains active; you may request deletion by contacting <a href="mailto:info@compendiumnav.com">info@compendiumnav.com</a>.</p>

      <h3>5. Data Sharing</h3>
      <p>We do not sell or share personal information with third parties. Information may be disclosed only when required by law or to protect our legal rights.</p>

      <h3>6. Connectivity & Networking</h3>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Local Network Access:</strong> The app discovers and communicates with your onboard server via the local network.</li>
        <li><strong>Remote Access:</strong> When you are away from your boat, encrypted traffic is relayed through our VPS solely for connectivity. No data is stored there.</li>
        <li><strong>Bluetooth Sensors:</strong> Sensor metadata stays on the boat server; it is not uploaded to external services.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>7. Location Information</h3>
      <p>GPS data is generated by your onboard server to power weather, tide, and navigation features. We do not store your location data in the cloud.</p>

      <h3>8. Children’s Privacy</h3>
      <p>The service is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

      <h3>9. Security</h3>
      <p>We use encryption, access controls, and hardened infrastructure to protect your information. No security measure is perfect, so we recommend keeping your credentials secure and applying system updates promptly.</p>

      <h3>10. Your Choices</h3>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Update or delete your account data by emailing <a href="mailto:info@compendiumnav.com">info@compendiumnav.com</a>.</li>
        <li>Disconnect the app from your boat server at any time to stop data flow.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>11. Changes to This Policy</h3>
      <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Material changes will be communicated through the app or via email.</p>
